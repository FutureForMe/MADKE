(D) Spinal
Answer: Let's think step by step! The pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain within the sella turcica, a bony structure of the sphenoid bone. The cranial cavity, which houses the brain, contains the pituitary gland. In contrast, the abdominal cavity contains digestive organs, the pleural cavity surrounds the lungs, and the spinal cavity houses the spinal cord. Therefore, the pituitary gland is located in the cranial cavity. Therefore, the answer is [(B) Cranial].
